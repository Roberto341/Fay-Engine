# Updates
- July 11th 2025 - Added ImGui
- July 12th 2025 - Implmented ImGui - Sorta- and added a Map Editor
- Starting on July 12th I will be over hauling the map editor and relasing a full application for making maps and what not that will be available to the public
- Update July 13th todays commit has been pushed back to tomorrow because the map editor experienced a major bug dont worry I fixed it and the new version will be released in the morning 
 I also went and overhauled the map editor significantly it now features 
   - Configuration file loading to load assests in 
   - Textured tile display and normal Vec4 display
   - Fixed a issue with the imgui grid not matching the main window 
   - small tweaks to the save and load .world files 
- Also I've been contemplating this one so I'll break it down for ya 
- The game engine doesn't have a world loader its only in the game I'm currently making however I can implement it into the engine with a few things 
  - 1 only .world files will be supported 
  - 2 you wont be able to render any npcs 
  - multiple sprites wont render either 
  - Just so you know I'm working on a fix for it but it might take awhile I'm a one man band right now so please be patient
